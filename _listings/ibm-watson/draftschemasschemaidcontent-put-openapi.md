  title: IBM Watson IoT Platform Update the content of a draft schema definition file
  description: |-
    Updates the content of a draft schema definition file with the specified
    id.

    The schema definition file is passed to the Watson IoT Platform within a
    multipart POST (multipart/form-data).  The body of the POST **must**
    contain one part with a name of the **schemaFile** and the
    actual schema file as the body of the part.

    Please note that the schemaFilename and contentType properties of the
    schema definition will also be updated as a result of updating the
    content of the schema file.

        IoT Platform within a\nmultipart POST (multipart/form-data).  The body of

        metadata can be passed in other parts within the multipart\nPOST.  For example,
        to specify a description for the new schema\ndefinition, you should include
        a part with the name **description** and\nthe description as the body of the
        part.  To specify the type of the\nschema, you should include a part with
        the name **schemaType** and one\nof the following in the body of the part
        (the schemaType defaults to\njson-schema if the no schemaType part is present):\n\n
        \ - json-schema\n\nIf parts with names other than those specified above are
        included in the\nmultipart POST the request will fail and an HTTP status code
